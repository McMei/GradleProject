# OOP Production Project
This is an individual school project from COP 3003. I designed a small program to help a media player production facility to track what products are produced.
I started this project on Aug 26, 2020 and ended on Dec 6. I have gained a lot and progressed heavily in JAVA.
Even though this project is a school assignment, I really do enjoy it. I was a little frustrated when unexpected things occurred like tons of exceptions, databases not working, etc. This project is not easy for sure, but after I completing it I felt really proud of myself. It took me coding skills to the next level. 
This is the first time I worked on the database and user interface, I had fun :)

**Scenario**

You have been hired to create software for a media player production facility that will keep track of what products are produced. 

Without the software, workers on the production floor are physically producing items and having to write down what is produced in a production log book. 

Management would like the production tracking to be more automated so the workers don't need to spend as much time recording what was produced, the log will be more accurate, and it will be easier to generate production reports. 

In addition to the ability to record production, the software also needs the ability to add to the product line (the catalog of products that are able to be produced).
