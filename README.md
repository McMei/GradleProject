# OOP Production Project
This is an individual school project from COP 3003. I designed a small program to help a media player production facility to track what products are produced.
I started this project on Aug 26, 2020 and ended on Dec 6. I have gained a lot and progressed heavily in JAVA.
Even though this project is a school assignment, I really do enjoy it. I was a little frustrated when unexpected things occurred like tons of exceptions, databases not working, etc. This project is not easy for sure, but after I completing it I felt really proud of myself. It took me coding skills to the next level. 
This is the first time I worked on the database and user interface, I had fun :)
