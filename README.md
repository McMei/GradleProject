# OOP Production Project
This is an individual school project from COP 3003. I'm creating a small program to help a media player production facility to track of what products are produced.
I started this project on Aug 26, 2020, for an assignment and improve my programming skill. 
I'm a junior in the college, also a newbie in programming. Be nice to me please(whispering).
This is the first time I work on the database and user interface. Hopefully it can comes out smoothly by the end of the semester.
## Demonstration
I will post a gif once I finished.
